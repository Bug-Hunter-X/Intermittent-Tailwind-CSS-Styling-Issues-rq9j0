I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  I had the correct configuration and imports set up, but the styles weren't being picked up.  My build process seemed to run without errors, but the styles simply didn't appear on the page. The issue was intermittent and seemed related to the order of class names.  Sometimes it would work, other times it wouldn't.
