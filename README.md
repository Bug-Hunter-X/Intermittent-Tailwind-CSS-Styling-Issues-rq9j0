This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS styles are intermittently not applied to HTML elements. The issue seems to be related to the order in which classes are applied, sometimes working correctly and other times failing to apply any Tailwind styling. The `bug.html` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.html` provides a solution to address this inconsistency. The core problem lies in a subtle ordering issue that can be resolved by carefully managing class attributes.
