The issue was resolved by ensuring the correct order of Tailwind classes, and in some cases, adding explicit important flags.  For example, instead of `<div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 text-white">`, which might fail intermittently, I used `<div class="p-4 bg-blue-500 text-white !important">`. Using the `!important` flag isn't ideal but could be used as a workaround while investigating the order issue. The root cause was likely an issue with class specificity or a conflict in class definitions.  A more robust solution would involve a thorough review of the CSS class structure to identify and resolve any conflicts or unintended specificity.
